## React-Pagination

Paginating objects using React JS. A random API has been integrated here using __axios__.
Implemented React Hooks which is according to me way better than using Class Components. Using Semantic UI just to make things readable.

> Install Dependencies

```
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

- Declare a new react app with lower case nomenclature. I recommend using :
```
npx create-react-app (name-in-lower-case)
```
- Change Directory
``` 
 cd (named directory for ur react application)
```
- Start the app
```
 npm start
```

You are good to go ....
